# Procedural Programming Paradigm:

# # Write a program to print the string in reverse order.
# str1 = input("Enter a string: ")
# print(str1[::-1])

# # write a program which will take integer and print 
# # whether it is even or odd.

# num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# if num % 2 == 0:
#     print("Even")
# else:
#     print("odd")

# # write a program which will greet you.
# print("Hello Shalini.!")

# Functional Programming Paradigm:-

# # Write a program to print the string in reverse order.
# def rev_string(str1):    # Header of the function
#     print(str1[::-1])

# rev_string("Kumar")
# rev_string("Harika")
# rev_string("Sanjana")
# rev_string("Karthik")

# # write a program which will take integer and print 
# # whether it is even or odd.

# def even_or_odd(num):
#     if num % 2 == 0:
#         print("Even")
#     else:
#         print("Odd")

# # even_or_odd(33)

# # write a program which will greet you.

# def greet():
#     print("Hello Shalini..!")

# # greet()     # call to the function


#----------------------------PRACTICE------------------------------

#1) Write a function which prints table of any number.
# def get_table(num):
#     for i in range(1, 11):
#         print(f"{num} * {i} = {num * i}")

# get_table(34)

#2) Write a function which will print Alphabetic 
   #charecters ascii code


#3) Write a function which does concatinnation of two different 
# strings

#4) Write a function which will convert any string to title string.

#5) write a function which will print todays date.
# import datetime
# print(datetime.datetime.today())

# write a function which will take two different numbers as attributes
# and print sum, multipliation, division and substraction.

# write a function which will take a number and find if the number 
# is even or odd, int or float.


# write a function which will take a tuple as an attribute
# and find the mode of it.
